**If I have PHP script, how can I get the filename of the currently executed file without its extension?**
Given the name of a script of the form `index.php`, how can I extract just the "index" part?

>`basename(__FILE__, ".php")` shows the name of the file where this code is included - It means that if you include this code in `header.php` and current page is `index.php`, it will return _header_ not _index_.

>`basename($_SERVER["REQUEST_URI"], ".php")` - If you use include this code in `header.php` and current page is `index.php`, it will return _index_ not _header_.
